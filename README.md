# Blog_Laravel
There will be two types of users in the application; Registered and Unregistered. Registered users are those who have already registered with the application. All the others are unregistered users.
Unregistered users will have read only access to the application. They can
•	View different posts and comments
•	Search for a specific blogger or a post
Unregistered users must register before creating any post or comment. To register, a unique email address and other basic information (according to your wish) is needed. The email address will be his/her username for the application.
Registered users can
